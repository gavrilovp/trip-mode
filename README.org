* Trip Mode
Emacs minor mode for logging stuff with relative timestamps:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Triplog: starting new trip at 28.10.2013 03:30:00+03
Dose: a cup of green tee
Age: 20 years
Body weight: 65 kg


T+00:00:00 A nice hot feeling in the stomach.

T+00:00:49 First minute of example for TripLog.
Press Enter two times to start a new paragraph.

T+00:03:04 A certain will to go and code some cool stuff!

T+00:06:08 Six minutes are already over.
Look, you can have subsequent two lines in a file.

T+00:22:14 But every two subsequent Enters will result in a new timestamp insertion.

T+0:34 You can close this file and open it again.  Just run the launching command, 
and the plugin will restore the start time from the first line.
#+END_SRC

** Usage
Plug it in with ~(require 'trip-mode)~ and either ~M-x trip-mode RET~ in a buffer or start a new trip: ~M-x trip-into-trip RET~.
